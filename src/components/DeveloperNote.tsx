              with React and Tailwind CSS. I spent way too much time perfecting the animations and probably drank 
              too much coffee â˜• in the process. The design system uses custom Poppins font because I got tired 
              of seeing Inter everywhere. All the gradients and hover effects? Yeah, those took longer than I'd like to admit.
